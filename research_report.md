### What is the purpose of this document?
- This document's purpose is to establish guidelines for how we want to complete our project
- This document describes the game we are coding and creating.
- This document's aim is to project our aims and goals we hope to meet during and after the creation of our project.

### Why are we doing this project?
- We are doing this project to help us understand and practice the Agile process in a group programming environment.
- We are studying the process of programming in a Test Driven way, which should lead to a better understanding of code and will hep us to write better code to create software.

#### Game description
- This game is an abstract boardgame invented by Edward De Bono in 1967.
- The board is a square with 12 uniform boxes, in a 4x4 sequence.
- The game's components consists of 2 'L'shaped tetrominos, and two 'coins'.
- The aim of the game is to move the pieces into a position where your opponent may not make another move, giving you victory.

#### Game rules
- This is a two player, turn based game, where player's move their pieces to block each other.
- On a player's turn they must move their tetromino into another position. It cannot be the same position as their current one.
- After they move their piece, they have the option to move one of the neutral 'coins'. These coins act as blockers which stop you from moving your piece into their position. 
- If a player cannot move their tetromino, they lose. 

#### Playing strategies
- There are many strategies to winning this game, many of which have been documented online.
- There are two very common strategies, which I will call the Mirror strategy, and the Half-Board strategy.
  - The Mirror strategy consists of using a neutral piece and one's own piece to block a 3Ã—3 square in one corner, and use a neutral piece to prevent the opponent's L piece from swapping to a mirror-image position.
  - The Half-Board strategy consists of using an L piece to block a half of the board, and use the neutral pieces to prevent the opponent's possible alternate positions.
- Both are tried and tested strategies which work well, however if neither player plays perfectly, defensive play can continue indefinitely if the players are too cautious to move a neutral piece to the killer positions

### Our hopes and aims for this project
- We aim to gain valuable knowledge about working in a team.
- We aim to learn about creating clean and concise code, and working in a Test Driven Development way.
- We aim to study and gain insight in creating tests in our language, C++, and using them to propel our project forward in a neat and understandable way, where we have thought about our solutions in depth before we start, leading to a more refined product.
- Finally, we aim to create a fun game which people will enjoy, and one that we can use as a part of our portfolios in the future.
